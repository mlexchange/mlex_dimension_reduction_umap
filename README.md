# mlex_dimension_reduction
Dimension reduction algorithms for the MLExchange platform. 
  - [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)
  - [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Getting started
To get started, you will need:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Running
First, build the dimension reduction image in terminal:
`cd mlex_dimension_reduction`
`make build_docker`

Once built, you can run the following examples:
`make UMAP_example`

These examples utilize the information stored in the folder /data. The computed latent vectors will be saved in /output.

#### TODO: run the container interactively
