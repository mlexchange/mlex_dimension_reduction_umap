# mlex_dimension_reduction
Dimension reduction algorithms using UMAP for the MLExchange platform

## Getting started

Set up a conda environment and install requirements:
```bash
conda create -n mlex_dimension_reduction_umap python=3.11
conda activate mlex_dimension_reduction_umap
pip install .
```

An example execution script is provided. To run it, first create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`, then run `/example_run.sh`.

## Developer Setup
If you are developing this library, there are a few things to note.

1. Install development dependencies:

```
pip install .
pip install ".[dev]"
```

2. Install pre-commit
This step will setup the pre-commit package. After this, commits will get run against flake8, black, isort.

```
pre-commit install
```

3. (Optional) If you want to check what pre-commit would do before commiting, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. To run test cases:

```
python -m pytest
```
